# Hello, Friend

My name is John, and I am an aspiring frontend devloper building my skills and seeking my first role. I enjoy using modern web technologies to build applications that both serve a purpose and solve technical problems in interesting ways. When I'm not developing, you can find me recording music, deep diving on new programming languages/technologies, or hiking in the woods.
